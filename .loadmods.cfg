// As a rule of thumb, complex addons need to be loaded first. Put them at the top.
// If you add new characters or followers to any of the repacks, make sure the count you want to add is maximum 3 from a single file. If there are more you'd like, just add the file in its entirety, and include a new "addfile" line for your mod file.

// Characters
// Server characters include any OCs made from members of Doc Octo
// SEGA Characters include any characters either from SEGA, or (fan made) OCs/AUs
// Misc Characters include basically any that don't fit the bill for the rest, which also include shitpost ones
// Pizza Characters include any chars related to Pizza Tower/McPigs personal projects, or OCs from McPig
// Game Characters and Cartoon Charaters are self explanatory
